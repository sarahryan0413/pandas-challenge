# Pandas School District Analysis project! ðŸŽ“ðŸ“Š

Imagine you're the Chief Data Scientist for a school district, and the school board needs your help making sense of student performance data. Your job? Analyze standardized test scores across multiple schools to uncover key trends in academic performance.

Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, I built a report that breaks down school performance by metrics like average math and reading scores, passing rates, school spending, and size. The goal is to answer big questions like:

- How do budgets impact student success?
- Do smaller schools perform better than larger ones?
- Which schools are excelling, and which ones need help?
This project is all about turning raw data into meaningful insightsâ€”no spreadsheets required! ðŸš€

### ðŸ“Š Whatâ€™s Included:
- A district-wide summary of key performance metrics
- School-by-school breakdowns of scores and budgets
- Analysis of performance by spending, school size, and school type
- Identification of the highest- and lowest-performing schools
- Grade-level trends in math and reading scores
Check out the analysis in the PyCitySchools notebook and see what insights you can uncover!
